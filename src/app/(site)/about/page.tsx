          The Story Behind GetColor.io
        </h2>

        <p className="text-md">
          I'm a software engineer with partial color blindness, specifically
          when it comes to distinguishing certain shades in the green and red
          spectrum. This condition affects approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in
          200 women worldwide ‚Äî hundreds of millions of people who might face
          similar challenges in everyday situations.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md">
          One day, I was at an IKEA store on a mission to buy a green chair for
          my daughter. What seemed like a simple task turned complicated when I
          couldn't differentiate the green chair from the gray one due to my
          color vision deficiency. The chairs' color variations fell exactly
          within the spectrum I struggle with. I needed a quick solution.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md">
          I turned to my smartphone, thinking there must be a{" "}
          <strong>camera color picker app</strong> that could help me identify
          the correct chair. However, my search led to disappointing results:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li className="text-md">
            <strong>Websites</strong>: Most were cluttered with ads, required
            uploading photos, and provided only HEX or RGB values without
            meaningful context.
          </li>
          <li className="text-md">
            <strong>Apps</strong>: Many hid essential features behind paywalls
            or were bogged down with intrusive ads. Even when functional, they
            offered limited assistance by displaying only technical color codes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-md">
          Frustrated by the lack of accessible and user-friendly options, I
          decided to create my own solution.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold pt-4">
          Creating a Better Camera Color Picker
        </h2>

        <p className="text-md">
          Leveraging my skills as a software engineer, I envisioned a simple,
          web-based <strong>camera color picker</strong> that:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li className="text-md">
            Works instantly without requiring downloads or installations.
          </li>
          <li className="text-md">
            Provides real-time color detection using the device's camera.
          </li>
          <li className="text-md">
            Is free to use and free from intrusive advertisements.
          </li>
          <li className="text-md">
            Offers meaningful color information accessible to everyone.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-md">
          With the help of modern web technologies and a bit of creativity, I
          developed a prototype in less than an hour. The initial version
          allowed users to open a webpage that accessed the camera and
          identified the color at the center of the screen. Testing it on my
          phone, I was thrilled to see it work seamlessly.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md">
          Encouraged by the prototype's success, I refined the tool by enhancing
          the user interface and adding controls for various scenarios. I built
          a website around it and made it publicly available as GetColor.io.
